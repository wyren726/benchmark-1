/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/README.md:272:- `Portability`: the success rate of editing for reasoning/application(one hop, synonym, logical generalization)
/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/examples/MMEdit.md:93:The selection of editing methods is a **crucial** step, as different methods have their own strengths and weaknesses. Users need to consider the trade-off between editing success rate, generalization, and maintaining unrelated performance.
/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/examples/WISE.md:29:In this paper, we point out the impossible triangle of current lifelong modeling editing approaches that reliability, generalization, and locality can hardly be achieved simultaneously. We find the reason behind this is the gap between working and long-term memory.
/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/examples/WISE.md:34:- 2️⃣ **Side Memory**: Initialized with the weights of the main memory, dedicated to holding edited knowledge, ensuring minimal conflicts and preserving generalization capabilities.
/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/examples/PROMPT.md:30:- **Prompt** field will automatically change according to the evaluation metric. When evaluating editing accuracy, the prompt corresponds to the prompt field in the original data. When evaluating generalization, the prompt corresponds to the rephrase field in the original data. When evaluating portability, the prompt corresponds to the portability_prompt field in the original data, and so on.

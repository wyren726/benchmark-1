/home/wyren/Knowledge-Editing-Benchmark/EasyEdit/examples/WISE.md:29:In this paper, we point out the impossible triangle of current lifelong modeling editing approaches that reliability, generalization, and locality can hardly be achieved simultaneously. We find the reason behind this is the gap between working and long-term memory.

Its performance across reliability and generalization remains robust up to 1000 edits, but locality decreases at this level.el.el.el."
